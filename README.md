A very simple php template engine
=================================

Just a very simple, but working php template engine based on output buffering. The code is based on a [blog entry](http://www.developer-b.com/blog/entry/363/2010/mar/22/dead-simple-php-template-engine) I wrote some time ago.

Have a look at the unit tests for usage examples.
